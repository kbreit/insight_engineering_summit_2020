This is the repository for Insight's 2020 CDCT Engineering Summit in Denver, CO.

## Preparation

If you already have a GitHub account, please make sure you're able to push to a repository you own. If you can, you're ready to go.

If you are new to GitHub please setup an account.

1. Create a new account at https://github.com/join?source=header-home.
2. Set your profile as much as you wish. Names, pictures, all are useful.
3. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it on your computer. This class will focus on the command line interface but there are graphical interfaces you're welcome to use.
4. Test git works by going to the terminal and execute "git version". It should respond with a version.
5. Set your git identity using these commands:
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
