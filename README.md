# Insight Engineering Summit 2020

This is the repository for Insight's 2020 CDCT Engineering Summit in Denver, CO.

## Preparation

If you already have a GitHub account, please make sure you're able to push to a repository you own. If you can, you're ready to go.

If you are new to GitHub please setup an account.

1. Create a new account at https://github.com/join?source=header-home. You'll need to use your password in clear text during today's session and have it stored in an unencrypted file. Please use a new password which you don't use anywhere else.
2. Set your profile as much as you wish. Names, pictures, all are useful.
3. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it on your computer. This class will focus on the command line interface but there are graphical interfaces you're welcome to use.
    * **Note**: If you happen to be a macOS user and use Homebrew, you can install git using Homebrew. If you're on Linux, use your distribution's package manager.
4. Test git by going to the terminal and execute `git version`. It should respond with a version. Note: I recommend using the Git bash program if you're on Windows.
5. Set your git identity using these commands:
```
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
